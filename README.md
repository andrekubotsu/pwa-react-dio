# PWA Example Project / PWA News DIO

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was made at DIO's Localiza Labs Bootcamp. The main goal was to understand better the PWA (Progressive Web Application). This is project is using ESlint and Prettier.

## What was challenging?

- configuring ESlint rules. Since this project was little old, it was necessary to update somethings and linting brought some code warnings/errors;

## What was interesting?

- to learn more and understanding better the concepts of PWA: manifest file, service worker, and configurations;

## Dependencies

- react-router-dom: ^5.3.0;
- antd: ^4.16.13";
- prop-types: ^15.7.2,

## Mock API (pwa-news-dio-api folder - remember to `yarn`)

- it is possible to run, just use `yarn dev`
- it is inside, but you can use it solo

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
